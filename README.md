# Spring-Boot-Carpooling-Project
Spring Boot-based carpooling platform with real-time tracking, dynamic pricing, and secure authentication for optimized and efficient travel.

### WHY?
Car hailing at the peak time (office or school) is difficult in metropolitan cities. Car-hailing apps like Uber or Ola have a feature of scheduling a ride but start finding the ride 15 min before the time. A person would be much relieved if a driver is assigned the previous night itself, moreover, the driver gets a confirmed business for tomorrow. The carpooling technique is incorporated to make travel cheaper, environment friendly, and reduce traffic on the road. The prime users of such an app would be frequent commuters like professionals and students.

## What?
- Users will register themselves with pickup, destination, time, and tier.
- Upon making a pooling request the user is given an estimated cost and time.
- The requests are grouped together, and a route is made and published in the drivers' network.
- The drivers get to see pooling requests with route and invoice; they accept whichever interests them.
- The user gets a confirmation notification for their scheduled ride.
- Driver reaches the pick-up locations and confirms the rider using OTP.
- A real-time GPS tracking tells the rider and their loved ones their travel status.
- The trip ends for the driver when all the passengers are dropped off at their respective locations.
- The invoice is processed and payment is settled to the driver at the end of the day.
- To ensure the rider gets a confirmed booking the pricing is kept dynamic. For example, a car can accommodate 3 passengers, but only one person is allocated, the person might need to pay for the full cab. But while riding, if the cab gets more passengers the cost is reduced.

*Prototype Features*
- Pre-defined routes like bus stops for pick-up and drop-off.
- The user puts a request with a pickup, and drop off location with timing and gets an estimated cost.
- Pool requests are clubbed together and sent to the drivers' network with route and invoice.
- The driver accepts the request upon their interest.
- The trip starts when the passenger is authenticated through OTP/PIN.
- At the end of the trip the cost is deducted from the user's wallet and paid to the driver.
